Two of the most hyped manga I'd always heard about but never tried until 2022. I'll be honest—I wasn't exactly excited to start two series I knew would never have proper endings. Even after reading them, I'm left with some mixed feelings.

These two are undeniably among the greatest works in manga, and they're held up by many as the pinnacle of the seinen genre.

## What's the Difference Between Seinen and Shonen?

Seinen and shonen are terms that classify manga and anime by audience. Shonen targets younger readers (usually boys) and leans heavily into action, friendship, and a straightforward good-vs-evil dynamic. Think _Naruto_ and _Dragon Ball_—big battles, growth arcs, and hope-filled narratives.

Seinen, on the other hand, is geared toward an adult audience, often delving into darker, grittier themes with complex characters. _Vagabond_ and _Berserk_ are prime examples, both tackling mature themes of identity, purpose, and moral ambiguity.

## Vagabond

I started with _Vagabond_, and I'll say this: I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Following Musashi's evolution was a wild experience, and the character work here is excellent. Here's a rundown of the four key moments that absolutely stayed with me:

1. **Kojiro's Introduction**  
   Initially, I had no clue what was going on with Kojiro. Why did we suddenly shift away from the main character to follow some random deaf guy? But wow—Kojiro turned out to be something special. As a rival, he's unique in a way I haven't seen often in other stories. Given _Vagabond_ is based on a real-life legend, I expect Musashi to eventually win if they face off, but I'd still be rooting for Kojiro.

2. **Kojiro vs. Ittosai—Tiger and Tiger**  
   This fight was absolute peak. Watching these two go at it was both intense and symbolic. _Vagabond_ doesn't just have good fights; it's also masterful at weaving in character depth during combat.

3. **Musashi vs. Seventy Samurai**  
   I didn't believe this was actually happening until I saw it through. One man against seventy—brutal, exhausting, and an unforgettable showcase of Musashi's skill and philosophy.

4. **The Farming Arc**  
   This might sound strange, but the Farming Arc is hands-down my favorite part. For some reason, when a story takes a break from action for something as mundane as farming, it often brings out the best character development. _Vagabond_'s Farming Arc is no exception. It's a grounded, introspective segment that just hits differently.

**Rating: 15/20**

## Berserk

Then came _Berserk_, arguably the most famous of the two and widely considered one of the greatest mangas ever. And look, I get why people love it, but I have some issues.

First off, the overuse of nudity. I don't care what anyone says—90% of the time, it's unnecessary and detracts from the story. I don't vibe with that. If _Berserk_ cut back on this, it would be a lot better.

That aside, _Berserk_ has some incredible moments. The **Golden Age Arc** is one of the best flashbacks I've read, with Griffith standing out as an insane villain and Guts as an enduring lead. But the frequent violence against Casca? Totally overdone. If it happened only during the Eclipse, maybe it would make sense, but it's so repetitive that it drags down the story.

**Rating: 8/20**

## The Non-Endings

Oddly enough, I found myself more satisfied with where _Berserk_ ended than _Vagabond_. Out of the two big moments I wanted closure on in each series, I at least got one in _Berserk_:

- **Guts & Casca Reunion**
- **Guts vs. Griffith**

The couple reunion was something I had been waiting for, and thankfully, it happened. Sure, there's still the unresolved tension with Griffith, but getting this moment between Guts and Casca felt meaningful.

In _Vagabond_, I had similar hopes:

- **Musashi & Otsu Reunion**
- **Musashi vs. Kojiro Showdown**

But, nope—we're left without either, making it feel like a major missed opportunity. If Inoue ever picks _Vagabond_ back up, I'd be thrilled. Out of all the manga I've read, _Vagabond_ had the potential to be one of the greatest stories ever, especially if it had a fitting adaptation. The farming arc alone deserves an animation treatment!

# Final Thoughts

Both _Vagabond_ and _Berserk_ had potential for much more than what we ultimately got. They've both left a mark on manga as art and storytelling, but neither feels truly complete. That said, they each capture something unique—_Vagabond_'s introspective journey and _Berserk_'s dark, relentless exploration of survival and revenge. If you're considering one, know that these stories are brutal but rewarding, even if unfinished.
