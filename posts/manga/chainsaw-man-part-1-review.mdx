# Chainsaw Man Part 1 Review

If I had to describe _Chainsaw Man_ Part 1 in one phrase, it would be “a fever dream.” It's one of those stories that, once you start, **you just can't stop**—all 97 chapters feel like an intense, visceral ride that keeps pulling you back in for more. This series is unpredictable, bloody, and full of twists that leave you hooked.

With a score of **17/20**, _Chainsaw Man_ Part 1 firmly holds a spot among some of the best manga out there. It's bold, it's chaotic, and it's definitely not for the faint of heart.

## A Wild, Nail-Biting Journey

From the very beginning, _Chainsaw Man_ is relentless in its pace. There's a raw energy to each chapter that makes it feel like a **nail-biter**; you're constantly on edge, wondering what could possibly happen next. The series dives into **dark, intense themes** with no apologies, mixing horror, dark humor, and shocking violence in a way that feels unique and almost experimental.

The story centers around Denji, a down-and-out guy who finds himself at the mercy of some of the **most powerful devils** imaginable. His journey is both tragic and weirdly uplifting, constantly testing his will and pushing him to unimaginable limits.

## The Hell Arc

The **Hell Arc** deserves a special mention. It's one of the most insane, unforgettable arcs in the series, pushing both the characters and the readers into absolute chaos. The sheer sense of dread, the atmosphere, and the hellish setting are captured so perfectly that it feels like you're reading a horror story that transcends typical manga. This arc alone makes _Chainsaw Man_ a standout, adding depth and unpredictability to the story that left a lasting impression on me.

## Makima: The Standout Character

If there's one character that defines _Chainsaw Man_, it's **Makima**. She's mysterious, manipulative, and powerful, with layers that you only begin to understand as the story unfolds. Makima's presence adds a constant sense of danger and fascination. She's one of my favorite characters, not just for her complexity but for the way she controls the narrative, drawing Denji (and the readers) into her web.

The way she plays both protagonist and antagonist, always one step ahead, is nothing short of masterful. She's captivating, terrifying, and impossible to look away from—easily one of the most intriguing characters I've come across.

It's **one of the best manga stories** I've read, with its feverish pacing, insane plot twists, and complex characters that you both love and fear. It pushes the boundaries of conventional storytelling, and each chapter keeps you on edge, wondering where the story will go next.

**Final Rating: 17/20** - A high-energy, darkly captivating story that's both horrifying and exhilarating. If you haven't read _Chainsaw Man_, you're missing out on one of the most intense manga experiences out there.
