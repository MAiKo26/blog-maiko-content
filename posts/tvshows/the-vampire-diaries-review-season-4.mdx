# The Vampire Diaries Season 4 Review

## Opening Thoughts

Season 4 continues to explore the aftermath of Elena's transformation into a vampire. The show dives deeper into the complexities of her new identity while balancing the ongoing conflicts with the Originals. This season really showcased the duality of Elena's character and how her relationships evolve under the pressure of her transformation.

## The Plot

### Main Plot Points

- **Elena's Transition**: The season revolves around Elena grappling with her new vampire identity and the challenges that come with it, including her humanity switch.
- **Hunter's Mark**: The plot involving Jeremy and Caroline discovering the Hunter's mark is a highlight, bringing thrilling new elements to the story.
- **The Search for the Cure**: While it was a central plot, I found the chase for the cure to be less compelling compared to other arcs in the series.
- **Bonnie Bennett's Growth**: Bonnie shines this season, showcasing her growth and power as a witch, making her one of the standout characters.
- **Klaus and the Originals**: The presence of the Originals continues to elevate the storyline. Klaus and his family add layers of complexity and excitement to the series.

## Character Notes

- **Elena Gilbert**: Her struggles with her vampire identity were relatable, but her humanity switch felt drawn out and uninspired at times.
- **Jeremy Gilbert**: The Hunter's mark plot gave Jeremy a purpose and an interesting arc this season.
- **Bonnie Bennett**: As always, Bonnie is a highlight, showcasing her strength and development throughout the season.
- **Klaus Mikaelson**: The introduction of _The Originals_ spin-off is a significant highlight, as Klaus's character adds depth and excitement to the series. In my opinion, this spin-off is even better than _The Vampire Diaries_ itself, and I plan to review it later.

## Rating

Season 4 was a mixed bag for me. While I enjoyed the Hunter's mark plot with Jeremy and Caroline and appreciated Bonnie's character development, the chase for the cure didn't resonate as strongly. Additionally, Elena's humanity switch was a dull point in the season. Overall, I rate this season a **15/20**.
