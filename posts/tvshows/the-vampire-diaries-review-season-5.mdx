# The Vampire Diaries Season 5 Review

## Opening Thoughts

After the thrilling arcs of the previous seasons, I approached Season 5 with high expectations. However, the excitement quickly fizzled out, leaving me feeling like I was watching a different show altogether.

## The Plot of Season 5

This season dives into new storylines and introduces several characters, but ultimately feels like a step down from the intensity and intrigue of the earlier seasons. The overall direction didn't resonate with me, leading to a lack of engagement.

### Key Plot Points

- **College Life**: The characters transition to college, but the dynamics feel forced and less compelling compared to their high school experiences.
- **New Characters**: Several new faces are introduced, but they fail to make a significant impact on the storyline or character development.
- **Romantic Drama**: The love stories take center stage, but they lack the depth and excitement of previous seasons.
- **Return of Old Foes**: While some familiar faces return, their storylines don't hold the same weight as before.

## Character Notes

- **Elena Gilbert**: Her journey this season felt stagnant, and the lack of character growth was disappointing.
- **Damon Salvatore**: Still a standout character, but even his charm couldn't save the season from feeling lackluster.
- **Stefan Salvatore**: His character arc was underwhelming, and I found myself wishing for more depth and intrigue.
- **Bonnie Bennett**: A highlight once again, but I felt her potential was not fully utilized this season.

## Rating

Overall, Season 5 was a letdown compared to its predecessors. It lacked the engaging storylines and character development that made earlier seasons so enjoyable.

**Rating: 13/20**
