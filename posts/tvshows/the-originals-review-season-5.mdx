### Rating

**Rating: 16/20**

The combination of thrilling supernatural elements and emotional depth makes Season 5 a fitting conclusion to the series, while still leaving a lasting impression on the audience.

## Thoughts on _Legacies_

As a spin-off, _Legacies_ has been a significant disappointment. It strays from the darker, more complex tone of _The Vampire Diaries_ and _The Originals_, opting for a lighthearted, humorous approach that feels out of place within the established universe.

The characters of Hope and Alaric deserved a show that respected the legacy of their predecessors rather than one that diluted the intensity and emotional weight that fans loved. The humorous tone undermines the serious themes explored in the original series, making it feel like a completely different world.

After dropping _Legacies_ after Season 1, I can confidently say that it failed to capture the essence of what made _The Originals_ and _TVD_ so compelling. Even the much-anticipated return of Kai fell flat, lacking the gravitas and charm that his character embodied in the earlier series. Overall, _Legacies_ feels like a wasted opportunity that detracted from one of my favorite universes of all time.
