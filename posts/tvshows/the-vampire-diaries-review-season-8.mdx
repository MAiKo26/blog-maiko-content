# The Vampire Diaries Season 8 Review

## Opening Thoughts

Season 8 of _The Vampire Diaries_ was a disappointing experience for me, feeling more like a chore than an engaging watch. The contrast between this season and the brilliance of _The Originals_ is stark and highlights the decline in quality that _TVD_ suffers in its final stretch.

## The Plot of Season 8

This season feels like a series of missed opportunities, with plotlines that drag on and fail to deliver the excitement and depth that earlier seasons brought. The pacing is off, and the stakes seem lower, making it difficult to stay invested in the characters and their journeys.

### Key Points

- **Overall Boredom**: The narrative felt repetitive and lacked the tension that characterized earlier seasons. The excitement and urgency of the storylines have diminished significantly, making for an overall boring experience.

- **Wasted Potential**: Many plot points feel like a waste of time, as if the writers struggled to find a compelling direction for the story. The introduction of new threats and characters does little to revive the interest in the series, and by this point, I felt that _TVD_ should have concluded after Season 6.

- **Contrast with _The Originals_**: Watching _The Vampire Diaries_ alongside _The Originals_ only accentuates the flaws in the former. The richness of storytelling and character development in _The Originals_ makes _TVD_'s shortcomings even more glaring.

## Rating

Ultimately, Season 8 of _The Vampire Diaries_ left me feeling disappointed and unfulfilled. It feels like a hollow conclusion to a series that once had so much potential.

**Rating: 10/20**
