When you think about the **roots of shonen anime**, _Dragon Ball_ and _Dragon Ball Z_ stand as foundational pillars. These series are often credited as the **father of shonen anime**, inspiring countless stories and characters that followed. With iconic sagas, unforgettable characters, and moments that defined a generation, the franchise deserves a **solid 14/20** in my book.

## Story and Legacy

The story begins with _Dragon Ball_, introducing us to a young Goku on his journey of growth, friendship, and battle. As we transition to _Dragon Ball Z_, the stakes are raised, and the series dives deeper into themes of power, resilience, and protecting loved ones. While the storyline isn't complex, its execution and Goku's journey inspired a _shonen legacy_. This series set the standards for many tropes and themes we now associate with shonen anime: training arcs, transformations, and the idea of constantly challenging oneself.

Without _Dragon Ball_, the landscape of anime would look vastly different. The influence of Goku's journey can be seen in characters like _Naruto_, _Luffy_, _Ichigo_, and many others who took inspiration from this ultimate warrior's path.

## Favorite Arcs: Cell and Buu Sagas

While _DBZ_ is packed with memorable arcs, the **Cell Saga** and the **Buu Saga** are true standouts for me. These arcs bring some of the most thrilling battles and story twists, pushing the characters to their limits and giving us iconic moments.

The **Cell Saga**, especially, hits a high note with the **Gohan Super Saiyan 2 transformation**. This is one of my all-time favorite moments in the series. Watching Gohan tap into his hidden power, standing up to Cell with that raw, explosive strength—it's simply legendary. The buildup, emotion, and Gohan's resolve to protect his friends and family make this scene one for the ages.

The **Buu Saga** brings its own excitement with unique villains, incredible fusions, and unexpected twists. The arc plays with new ideas and pushes the Z Fighters to new heights, making it a great follow-up to the Cell arc and a fitting culmination of Goku and Vegeta's rivalry.

## Iconic Moments and Influence

Beyond specific sagas, _Dragon Ball Z_ is packed with iconic moments that have become almost legendary in anime. The first time we see a Super Saiyan, the epic battles on Namek, Vegeta's redemption arc, and countless transformations—these moments defined what it means to be a shonen anime.

Characters like **Goku, Vegeta, and Gohan** have an enduring legacy. Each of them represents different facets of the shonen spirit—Goku with his relentless pursuit of strength, Vegeta with his pride and redemption, and Gohan with his potential and inner strength.
