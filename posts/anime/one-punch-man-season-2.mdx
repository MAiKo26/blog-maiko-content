# One Punch Man Season 2 Review

Season 2 of _One Punch Man_ continues the overpowered comedy and superhero satire of the first season, but with a few drawbacks. Saitama's journey as the unbeatable hero stays true to the original spirit, but there's no denying the shift in animation quality compared to Season 1. JC Staff took over from Madhouse for this season, and while it still has its moments, the visual impact just isn't the same.

## Animation: A Step Down

The animation in Season 2 doesn't reach the intense, polished heights of the first season. The battles aren't as fluid or sharp, which is a bit of a letdown, especially since the action was such a big draw in Season 1. There are still some cool scenes, but overall, the impact isn't as strong. It's clear that the animation budget or approach took a hit, and it does affect the viewing experience.

## Saitama and the Same Gag

Despite the animation dip, Saitama's character and humor stay pretty much the same. He's still ridiculously overpowered, and the “one punch” gag continues to be funny in that repetitive, deadpan way. However, without the high-quality animation to back it up, the joke doesn't hit as hard this time around.

## The Introduction of Garou

One interesting addition in Season 2 is the character of Garou, a “hero hunter” who brings a different energy to the show. While he's not exactly a complex villain, he adds a new layer to the hero-villain dynamic, giving us a break from Saitama's invincible routine. Garou's arc brings some darker themes and adds depth to the story, which is a nice touch for a season that otherwise struggles to capture the magic of the first.

## Final Thoughts

_One Punch Man_ Season 2 is still enjoyable if you liked the humor and action of Season 1, but the drop in animation quality is hard to ignore. The story tries to branch out a bit with new characters like Garou, which adds some freshness to the familiar setup. Still, it's best approached with lower expectations compared to the first season.

**Rating:** 12/20
