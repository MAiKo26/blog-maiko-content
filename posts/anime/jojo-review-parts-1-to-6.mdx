Watching _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ has been a ride unlike any other, from its Victorian-era origins in _Phantom Blood_ to the prison of _Stone Ocean_. As an anime-only viewer, I've experienced the story up through Part 6, and I have to say it's one of the most unique anime journeys out there. The series is packed with unforgettable characters, bizarre powers, and plenty of iconic moments, even if some parts shine brighter than others. Here's my detailed breakdown of each part:

## Part 1: Phantom Blood - **9/20**

_Phantom Blood_ sets up the Joestar family legacy, introducing Jonathan Joestar and the infamous Dio Brando. It's a short, foundational arc, so while it doesn't have the stylistic flair or intense battles that later parts are known for, it lays essential groundwork. Jonathan is portrayed as the noble, heroic archetype, which in many ways feels a bit plain, especially compared to later Joestars.

What _Phantom Blood_ does right, though, is establish Dio as a villain. Dio's transformation from Jonathan's manipulative brother to a vampiric force of evil is captivating, and while Jonathan's character didn't quite grab me, the story had enough intrigue to keep me watching. Dio's charm and ruthlessness carry this part, foreshadowing the massive role he'll play in the series later on.

## Part 2: Battle Tendency - **14/20**

_Battle Tendency_ was a huge step up and solidified my interest in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_. Joseph Joestar brings an entirely different energy compared to Jonathan—he's funny, witty, and never misses a chance to talk his way out of a fight. Joseph's dynamic personality and unconventional tactics bring a refreshing pace to the series, and watching him outsmart his enemies with humor and cunning is endlessly entertaining.

The Pillar Men, ancient beings who serve as the main antagonists, are memorable villains with unique powers and motivations. The battles are creative and intense, especially Joseph's showdown with the cunning Kars, where strategy takes center stage over sheer power. Joseph's character growth, from an impulsive, reckless fighter to a determined and clever Joestar, really makes this part shine. For me, Joseph absolutely **carried JoJo** through this arc, making _Battle Tendency_ a standout part of the series.

## Part 3: Stardust Crusaders - **15/20**

_Stardust Crusaders_ is where _JoJo_ truly begins to feel like a globetrotting adventure. The introduction of Stands—a unique power system that adds depth and creativity to battles—completely redefines the series. Each Stand has its own unique abilities, allowing for a wide range of fighting styles, from close-range brawlers to long-distance strategists, adding an extra layer of unpredictability to each battle.

With Jotaro as the new protagonist, we get a quieter, more stoic Joestar, but Joseph's return as part of the team adds a lot of nostalgic charm. Watching Joseph navigate the bizarre and intense Stand battles with his still-sharp wits was a highlight, especially given his past as a fearless fighter in _Battle Tendency_. This part also reintroduces **Dio in a powerful way**, giving him a new Stand and an even greater aura of menace. The journey across continents to finally confront Dio in Egypt has a sense of high stakes and epic scale, with each battle along the way offering something new.

And then there's the iconic finale: Jotaro vs. Dio, where _The World_ and _Star Platinum_ clash in one of anime's most intense battles. This showdown solidified _Stardust Crusaders_ as a top-tier arc for me, with a satisfying conclusion to the Joestar vs. Dio saga that had been building up since _Phantom Blood_.

## Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable - **12/20**

_Diamond is Unbreakable_ takes a turn toward the quirky and intimate, focusing on the small town of Morioh and a more relaxed, slice-of-life approach. Josuke, the fourth JoJo, is a likable protagonist with a more easygoing and approachable personality compared to Jotaro. His Stand, _Crazy Diamond_, also brings a unique twist, as its ability to heal and fix things adds a different dynamic to the battles.

While the smaller setting and more localized story allowed for some unique storytelling, I felt this part lost some of the intensity of _Stardust Crusaders_. Kira, the main antagonist, is intriguing, with his unsettlingly ordinary appearance masking a dark obsession with murder. The story's tonal shift to a more personal conflict worked well, but I did miss the epic, globe-trotting feel. It's a solid part with memorable moments, but didn't reach the high stakes I loved in _Stardust Crusaders_.

## Part 5: Golden Wind - **11/20**

In _Golden Wind_, we leave the Joestar family behind in favor of Giorno Giovanna, a Joestar descendant with a unique connection to Dio. The shift to Italy and the new focus on the mafia brought a fresh angle, and while Giorno's noble aspirations are compelling, I just didn't feel as invested in his journey compared to past protagonists. The supporting cast, like Bruno Bucciarati, is engaging, but the part as a whole didn't hit as hard.

While the Stand battles are creative and brutal, there's something about this part that didn't quite grab me. It felt like the story was moving away from the established legacy of the Joestar family, which is a big part of what I love about _JoJo_. While the fights are undeniably well-crafted, the connection to the previous parts felt tenuous, leaving _Golden Wind_ a bit out of sync with my favorite elements of the series.

## Part 6: Stone Ocean - **12/20**

_Stone Ocean_ brings back the Joestar family with Jolyne, the first female JoJo, which adds a new, refreshing perspective. The prison setting adds a darker, grittier tone to the series, and Jolyne's fierce, determined personality is a great fit for the role. Jotaro's return as a father figure adds a lot of emotional depth, and watching Jolyne forge her own path while trying to escape the prison is gripping.

However, by the end, we encounter a plot twist that sets up a “reset” for the Joestar family's legacy, which left me feeling a bit torn. The final episodes take the series in an unexpected direction that has big implications for the entire lineage of Joestars. I appreciated the risks taken with the narrative, but I'm left with mixed feelings on whether this reset enhances or detracts from the overall story. It's a bold conclusion to Jolyne's arc, though, and a fascinating way to end Part 6.

_JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ is truly an iconic journey, with each part adding its own unique flavor to the Joestar saga. From Joseph's clever antics to Jotaro's cool-headed determination, and Jolyne's resilience, the series offers a spectrum of unforgettable characters. Each arc has its ups and downs, but as a whole, _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ has redefined what anime storytelling can be, solidifying its place as a legendary series.
