_Demon Slayer_ is one of those series that just pulls you in with its **incredible visuals and dynamic action**. From seasons 1 to 3, it's proven itself to be a **solid 13/20** for me. With a straightforward story, breathtaking animation, and memorable battles, it's a great pick to introduce new viewers to anime, much like _Full Metal Alchemist_. The story hits classic anime notes without getting too complex, which is honestly a big part of its charm.

## Story and Plot

The plot is simple but effective. We follow Tanjiro Kamado on his journey to avenge his family and find a cure for his demon sister, Nezuko. There's nothing revolutionary in the storytelling—it's a pretty classic journey of growth, friendship, and battles against powerful enemies. However, it's the execution that makes _Demon Slayer_ stand out. The show keeps things direct and accessible, making it enjoyable for casual viewers or those new to anime.

Each season progresses through new layers of Tanjiro's journey, but it doesn't overcomplicate things, making it a solid gateway series for newcomers.

## Animation and Visuals

One thing that _Demon Slayer_ does better than almost any anime out there is the **animation quality**. Ufotable's work here is just jaw-dropping, turning every fight into a visual spectacle. The vibrant colors, fluid movement, and unique art style keep the action engaging, and the level of detail is truly eye-catching.

The show doesn't rely on flashy visuals alone—though, let's be real, the **Tengen vs. Gyutaro fight** in Season 2 is worth all the praise it gets. It's a thrilling, high-energy clash that showcases everything the series does best, from animation to sound design to character moments. Tengen's combat style paired with Gyutaro's sinister presence made for one of the most memorable battles in anime in recent years.

## Characters

The character lineup is solid, with Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke each bringing their own quirks and personalities. The Hashira—especially Tengen Uzui in Season 2—add an interesting dynamic to the demon-hunting team. While the characters aren't particularly groundbreaking, they're easy to root for and are genuinely likable.

**Muzan Kibutsuji**—or as some fans call him, the "Michael Jackson" of anime—has this insane aura that instantly makes him a standout villain. His presence adds a looming threat to the story, and I'm genuinely excited to see Tanjiro face him down in future seasons.

## Overall Thoughts

If you're looking for an anime with a _standard but solid plot_, fantastic fights, and some of the best visuals in the medium, _Demon Slayer_ is a perfect choice. Its formula may be familiar, but it's a polished and well-executed version of that formula. Like _Full Metal Alchemist_, it's straightforward, entertaining, and ideal for those just getting into anime.

**Final Rating: 13/20** - _Demon Slayer_ is eye candy with a solid story to match. A must-watch for fans of top-tier animation.
