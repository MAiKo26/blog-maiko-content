I finally watched _Invincible_, and wow, it really lives up to the hype. I'm scoring it a **13/20** because it's been a refreshing take on animated superhero stories, bringing a darker, more intense side to the genre that rivals any anime in terms of grit and storytelling.

## The Brutal Edge of Animation

First things first: the **gore** in _Invincible_ is on another level. They didn't hold back, and it honestly worked. It's intense, raw, and visceral, making each fight feel incredibly high stakes. I didn't expect a U.S. animated comic adaptation to bring that level of intensity, but it's clear that _Invincible_ is out to prove that **Western animation can be just as hardcore as anime**.

## The Plot Twist That Sets It Apart

Then there's the twist right after episode 1. That moment with Omni-Man, Mark's dad, absolutely blew me away. It turns the whole story on its head, and the show dives into some pretty dark, emotional territory. _Invincible_ plays with typical superhero tropes but throws in unexpected, grounded moments that pack a punch.

## Season 2 Experience

Now, I'm in the middle of Season 2, and while I still love the story and characters, I have to admit I hate the way they cut episodes this season. It feels like it takes away from the immersion a bit, but the quality of the story keeps me invested.

**Overall**: For a show that proves animated comic series can compete with anime, _Invincible_ brings it. It's a fun, intense watch, and definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of superheroes with an edge.

**Rating: 12/20**
