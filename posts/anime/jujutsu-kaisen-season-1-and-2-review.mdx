_Jujutsu Kaisen_ is one of those anime that keeps you on the edge of your seat, delivering top-tier visuals and some of the most iconic characters in modern anime. With Season 1 setting the foundation and Season 2 reaching insane heights, it's a wild ride that keeps fans coming back for more. Here's my breakdown of the series so far:

## Season 1 - **14/20**

Season 1 of _Jujutsu Kaisen_ burst onto the anime scene with a mix of stunning animation and powerful, supernatural fights that immediately captivated fans. The story follows Yuji Itadori, a fairly straightforward protagonist who's strong-willed and determined to protect his friends. While he's a solid lead, I won't deny that he feels more like a passenger in his own story, taking a back seat to the series' real scene-stealers like Gojo, Sukuna, and Geto. Yuji's role as the main character is overshadowed by these larger-than-life personalities, but his connection to Sukuna adds an interesting dynamic to his otherwise conventional character arc.

Gojo Satoru, in particular, steals every scene he's in. He's effortlessly powerful, with a charisma and presence that's unmatched. His iconic moments and overwhelming abilities make him feel like a character from another dimension, breaking the mold of typical mentor figures in anime. Gojo's Limitless powers, especially _Domain Expansion_, are just jaw-dropping to watch and showcase some of the best animation work in recent years.

The battles in Season 1 are a visual treat, with fluid, high-energy animation that brings the dark, cursed world to life in vibrant colors and detailed choreography. From Yuji and Nobara's tag-team moments to Gojo's jaw-dropping power displays, _Jujutsu Kaisen_ quickly made a name for itself as an eye candy series with serious staying power. It's no surprise that the season's finale left fans hyped for what was next.

## Jujutsu Kaisen 0 (Film) - A Great Addition

The _Jujutsu Kaisen 0_ film adds further depth to the story, giving us Yuta Okkotsu's backstory. The film explores his journey with Rika, his cursed childhood friend, and shows how Yuta transforms from an insecure boy into a formidable sorcerer. This movie provides an intense look at the world of curses while giving us more Gojo screen time, which is always a plus. As a standalone story, it's gripping, emotional, and action-packed—serving as a perfect lead-in to the main series.

## Season 2 - **18/20**

Now, this is where _Jujutsu Kaisen_ reaches absolute peak territory. Season 2 has completely changed the game for shonen anime, bringing everything that worked in Season 1 to a whole new level. The _Shibuya Incident Arc_ in particular is a non-stop adrenaline rush with jaw-dropping fights, high-stakes drama, and some of the most intense character moments in the series.

The season kicks off with the heartbreaking _Hidden Inventory/Premature Death_ arc, revealing Gojo's backstory with Geto and fleshing out their friendship, their ideologies, and how they became the people they are in the present timeline. The line “_You are my special_” is a gut-wrenching reminder of the emotional weight behind the series, revealing how deep the connections go between these characters. This arc provides so much depth to Geto and Gojo's relationship, and it's one of the best character-driven arcs I've seen.

Then there's the _Shibuya Incident Arc_, which is easily the peak of _Jujutsu Kaisen_ so far. The non-stop action, complex fights, and sheer power displayed are on another level. Every fight seems to outdo the last, from Toji's insane comeback to Gojo's showdown against almost every curse user in the series. Watching Gojo in action is like watching a force of nature; he's so iconic that he might just be the most famous anime character of all time, giving Goku a serious run for his money. It's mind-blowing to see how much of a cultural phenomenon he's become in such a short time.

And let's not forget Sukuna's terrifying moments, especially his battles against Jogo and Mahoraga. Sukuna's power and malevolence are chilling, and his rivalry with Gojo and manipulations surrounding Yuji make him one of the most compelling antagonists in shonen today. The brutality, the stakes, the twists—they all contribute to making this arc an unforgettable experience.

While Yuji's role is still sidelined in comparison to the powerhouse cast around him, I like how the story doesn't shy away from focusing on the bigger players like Gojo, Sukuna, and Geto. It makes for a tight, intense narrative that doesn't get bogged down with filler or unnecessary detours. Yuji's just along for the ride, which works well given how strong the supporting cast is.

## Final Thoughts

_Jujutsu Kaisen_ has quickly become a shonen powerhouse with stunning animation, unforgettable characters, and a world that's as eerie as it is visually spectacular. The mix of dark themes, high-stakes battles, and layered characters makes it one of the best modern shonen anime around. With the Shibuya Incident setting a new standard for action, it's clear that this series isn't slowing down anytime soon. I can't wait to see what Season 3 brings and how it will top the already insane heights of Season 2.

If you're a fan of intense battles, complex characters, and a bit of the supernatural, _Jujutsu Kaisen_ is a must-watch. Whether you're drawn to the charisma of Gojo, the menace of Sukuna, or just want some jaw-dropping animation, this series has something for everyone.
